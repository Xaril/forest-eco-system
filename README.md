# Forest eco system

![Example image](images/image.png)

Simulation of a forest eco system with water cycle, grass, flowers, bees, foxes and rabbits.

## Description

The nature on our planet is essential in order for all living creatures to survive. One example of a natural environment is the forest, in which both plants and animals live and interact with each other. How these interactions work, and how these species affect each other is interesting, but due to the risky, potentially dangerous, and time consuming nature of performing experiments on populations in the wild, simulations must often be used to observe how species act. In this report, a simulation of a forest ecosystem has been implemented using behaviour trees, in which complex organisms interact with each other. More specifically, the ecosystem contained grass, earth, water, weather, flowers, bees, rabbits and foxes. The rabbits and foxes had genetic traits that were passed on to offspring. The ecosystem was observed in order to determine its stability, and to see how the genetic factors affected the foxes and rabbits. The results showed that the system had trouble stabilizing, but that some organisms could stabilize with each other. The problems revolved around the organisms dependence on each other, and the system's complex nature making it hard to find good solutions. The genetic factors seemed to evolve in the same direction for both foxes and rabbits, but due to the lack of stability in the system, no real conclusions can be drawn. Further research must be conducted in order to find a stable system in which genetic factors can be more thorougly observed.
